00:00 It's time to create our app
00:01 and actually start writing some code
00:03 and we're going to focus on that for the rest of the course.
00:05 So here we are on anvil.works.
00:08 Pretty cool domain.
00:09 We're going to get started building our app.
00:11 Now, like I said, you can create your account here.
00:13 Having a free one pretty much let's you do what you need
00:16 to do for most of what we're doing in this course.
00:19 Having a paid one obviously lets you do more.
00:23 For example, you can't host on a custom domain
00:25 like we're going to without a paid account.
00:27 So here we are, we're going to get started
00:29 by just clicking Start Building.
00:30 If we hadn't already logged in or registered
00:33 we would do that, but now it's just going to take us
00:35 straight to where we can create our app.
00:37 Now, one of the things that is a little tricky
00:39 for me working with Anvil is I always feel
00:42 like I have the webpage
00:44 and then I usually have an editor
00:46 but the webpage that I'm viewing and interacting with
00:49 created by Anvil, is also the editor.
00:52 You should press the Stop button as you'll see
00:54 and so in order to keep myself
00:56 from trying to close that window and go back to my editor
00:59 I like to have this full-screen
01:01 just dedicate all the space to it.
01:04 There's really no reason to leave our web browser, right?
01:07 It's going to both run our app
01:08 but also going to be where we're writing our app.
01:12 Now, the app we're going to create is a fitness app.
01:14 We've already sort of introduced that idea
01:16 and I call it Fitnessd without the e in there.
01:19 So Fitnessd, but without the e.
01:22 Here, you can see a little sample one I built
01:24 as I was writing this course
01:25 taking the screenshots and everything.
01:26 So we're going to start a new one
01:28 that's why you see it down there already.
01:30 So we're going to start with the material design one
01:34 and it comes down, and it's just not so creatively called
01:37 material design one.
01:39 So let's give it a name.
01:40 I'm going to call it Fitnessd, like that.
01:44 Now, rename it, now our app is good.
01:47 The next thing we want to do is we want to have
01:49 some links over here, so we're going to put a title.
01:53 On the right, you can see that there's sort of
01:56 this drag-and-drop thing we have.
01:58 Labels, we can put the labels over here.
02:01 We have maybe a button if we want to put the button there.
02:03 We can go and select the button
02:05 and, say, change its style like
02:08 it could say, Click Me.
02:10 And we could set its role to be primary
02:12 so it looks like this, and so on.
02:14 This is not really how we want our app to look
02:16 but just to show you really quickly
02:18 how this form designer works here.
02:21 Let's go ahead and put this title over here
02:23 that we're talking about, that they're suggesting we put.
02:26 I come down here, and I can rename these elements.
02:29 If you want to program against them
02:30 they should have good names, they always have names
02:32 even if you don't want to program against them
02:34 but you probably want to give them names.
02:37 So this is going to be labeled Title, like that.
02:40 And then, we could just put this up here
02:41 as Fitnessd.app or something like that.
02:45 This is going to be our title.
02:47 Okay, so here's how the form editor works.
02:50 We have a little output from when our app runs.
02:52 That's like the console, terminal type thing.
02:55 We have these forms here
02:57 so by default they're form one, form two
03:00 not super interesting
03:01 I'm going to rename this one to HomeForm.
03:06 And be like our main page, you'll see this is actually
03:08 the center of our application in a lot of interesting ways.
03:11 Here's the client side modules.
03:13 We can go and add one of those.
03:15 I'm going to get rid of it again 'cause we don't need it now
03:17 but it just creates, well
03:18 let me just look at it real quick.
03:20 It creates a Python file where we'd write Python code
03:23 but incredibly, this runs in the browser.
03:25 It never runs on the server.
03:27 The server modules are similar
03:29 but these are going to run on the server.
03:32 Right now, it's running.
03:34 We can write Python 2 code over there
03:37 but if we have the paid version
03:39 we can have full Python 3, which is great.
03:42 I definitely want to have that.
03:45 If you don't have the paid version
03:46 just write Python 2 code for now until you've decided
03:49 that it's worthwhile for you, but, of course
03:50 when I write code, it's going to be Python 3.
03:53 Python 2 is just about out of the loop.
03:56 It's just about deprecated and so on.
03:58 We're going to come back when I have some of those.
04:00 Here's the services that we talked about.
04:02 We could have our data table service, our user service
04:06 send an email, app secrets
04:08 Google Drive, and login, and whatnot
04:12 Facebook services, Microsoft
04:13 which requires the business account
04:15 and Stripe, as well as Uplink
04:17 those are some of the things we spoke about.
04:19 We can also configure the theme, and, just so you all know
04:22 I have the individual plan here.
04:26 Okay, so this is the basic look and feel of our app.
04:30 This is how it's going to work.
04:31 We're going to write code here
04:34 and then when it's time to run it
04:35 we just click this button.
04:37 Actually, there it is, it doesn't do anything.
04:38 It doesn't have anything going on
04:40 and maybe if we put a button or something right here
04:42 then you see this little button one.
04:44 Run it, there you go, now, we can go about
04:46 clicking our little button.
04:48 So our app is running, this is what I was talking about
04:50 with this sort of two experiences.
04:53 Here's where we work with our app and run our app
04:55 and debug it, and then you hit Stop
04:56 and you're back to the editor.
04:58 It's best to just have your web browser
05:00 absolutely full-screen.
05:01 Chrome is a little bit better than Firefox for this
05:03 'cause it actually hides the window
05:05 the tabs and everything, which I kind of like
05:08 but in general I prefer Firefox.
05:10 So here we go, we're going to be using Firefox for this.
05:13 All right, our app is created
05:15 and now, we're going to have to start
05:16 doing some cool drag-and-drop UI layout
05:19 to start creating our application properly.
