00:01 Okay, now that we know kind of
00:03 what our app is going to be doing
00:04 we can go and create these forms
00:05 that are going to go into this little component
00:07 that's hidden right there.
00:09 Now these are wrapping around 'cause they're too big
00:11 but remember only half of them will ever be shown at a time
00:14 so it shouldn't be a problem.
00:16 Right, now, let's go and add this here.
00:18 So we could choose another separate page
00:21 that looks totally different
00:22 like the one we just created
00:23 but like I said, we're going to have these components
00:26 that we can use as we navigate around our application.
00:29 There's a really interesting model
00:31 pretty straightforward to do
00:33 to swap in and out these views.
00:34 We're going to write a little module, client module
00:37 that's going to take care of that and just say go to Home
00:40 go to Add Measurement, and it's going to totally solve it.
00:43 So here is a basic form called Form One
00:46 not super loving the name
00:48 so let's go over here and give it a different name.
00:51 Let's say we have an AccountComponent.
00:54 We don't need to call it component
00:56 just to conceptually for us to know like
00:58 this one is being used in this way, I'm going to call it that.
01:01 And we could just do real quick just something
01:04 so we know that this is happening here.
01:07 A quick name for the text and just call this Account.
01:10 Something like that.
01:12 The next thing we can do is we can add another one of these.
01:15 We're going to need to have one for adding measurements.
01:19 This is probably the most involved form
01:21 in terms of user input and validation.
01:27 So AddMeasurementComponent.
01:30 And again just so you know what we're working with here
01:32 let's put a label here and put some text on it.
01:41 It could be like the title or something when we're done.
01:51 If we want to compare us against other people.
01:55 People that are our age or something like that
01:57 we might have this compare form.
01:59 That's one of our features.
02:03 Now we have the Home Form
02:04 but remember the Home Form is meant to be kind of like
02:06 the overall application.
02:07 So we want to dynamically swap out what you see
02:11 when you're logged in.
02:12 Just when you're laying on the sites.
02:13 We're going to have another one here like this
02:17 and its name can be HomeDetailsComponent.
02:23 Now it's easiest if we have a separate component
02:26 for when you're logged in
02:28 and you have details or when you first open the app but you're not yet logged in.
02:32 So we're going to have one more of these here
02:37 called HomeAnonComponent.
02:39 As anonymous, not logged in, that type of thing.
02:43 That pretty much does it.
02:44 It turns out we need one more thing
02:47 and I'm going to go ahead and just add it right now.
02:50 And I'm going to call this SetHeightComponent.
02:57 When you first register for the site it pops up a dialogue
03:00 that says what is your username, what's your email
03:03 what's the password you want to use.
03:04 Stuff like that. But, it doesn't let us ask additional information.
03:07 In order for us to compare you
03:09 like your weight, your heart rate.
03:10 Things that we're going to measure on you to others.
03:13 We need to compare.
03:14 We need to know like how tall are you, how old are you?
03:16 Things like that. So we're going to have this other form
03:18 that we're going to show just once to get
03:20 that information when you sign up.
03:22 Right so here's all the forms that we're going to use.
03:25 I'm going to load this up
03:26 and then dynamically put in here
03:28 the AccountComponent, AddMeasurementComponent, Compare
03:31 HomeDetails are anonymous
03:33 and then the one time when I get your height
03:35 and your age and things like that.
03:38 And then we're going to store it.
03:39 And we'll show you that one again.
03:40 But, we do need to form for that as well.
03:42 So it looks like we're just about ready to get going.
