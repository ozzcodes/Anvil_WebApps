00:00 Well, here's our AddMeasurementComponent
00:02 it's not super compelling is it?
00:04 It has just like the words, Add Measurement
00:06 what we want to do is build up
00:08 something cool and interactive.
00:09 Let me just show you over here
00:12 on the previously published version
00:14 health.python.com
00:16 we'll probably have fitnessd at the end
00:18 but this is the previous one.
00:20 So let me go and login.
00:26 And here's what I want this form to look like.
00:29 This is nice, right?
00:30 We've got this cool little top bar
00:32 we've got this called out card thing
00:35 that shows us what you can enter
00:36 we try to enter something that's invalid
00:39 We're going to end up with the way that's required
00:40 we have a numerical Up-down
00:42 we have a little placeholder text
00:45 we're going to collect the weight and pounds
00:47 and the resting heart rate and beats per minute
00:50 each day, theoretically.
00:51 So let's say I'm on 70.
00:54 Try to say this required and so on
00:56 and eventually if I add them all in there
00:58 we're going to save that in the database and move on
01:01 and show you like all your history of all your measurements
01:04 including this new one you added.
01:06 Okay, so we've got this cool error-handling here, and so on.
01:10 So this is what I want to build
01:12 at a nice little calendar and so on.
01:14 So how are we going to do this with Anvil?
01:17 Well, we're doing several parts.
01:19 First, we're just going to spec out the UI
01:21 then we're going to add the events
01:22 and then add the validation.
01:23 So we can make this a lot better by going down here
01:26 and setting some properties on it.
01:27 So Add Measurement, that's good.
01:30 But let's go and set some more values.
01:32 I wanted to go in the center
01:34 I want the font size to be
01:37 it's probably a little big about 28 pixels
01:42 Put 28. It's always pixels.
01:44 And then I want to set an icon, Member on the left
01:47 we had the scale, and we wanted to add this in the link.
01:51 And so we also want that topic over here
01:53 and this all we want to see that appear over there.
01:57 The next one we want, it's that little card.
01:59 So we're going to Come back over here
02:00 and there's all these different components
02:02 that we can drop in and even more if you expand them out.
02:06 So what we want is a card
02:07 it's going to go below
02:09 and it takes up all the space
02:11 has this little shadow
02:12 it's a slightly different background color.
02:14 And then here we want to have a couple of labels.
02:17 So one label it works a lot easier on a larger monitor
02:21 just going to be label, title, date
02:24 something like that.
02:27 That's just kind of date
02:28 like so, kind of boring
02:30 but we're going to have more stuff like it
02:32 so let's make a copy, can drag that
02:36 thing in here
02:39 in addition to the one that says date
02:40 we want that's a weight in pounds.
02:44 Already folks who are using the metric system
02:46 I love it as well but it got to pick something
02:48 so I'm just going to go with pounds, speed, title and pounds
02:53 something like that. Another one like this.
02:57 So we put it right, see the little blue drag it drop it
03:02 indicator, so this is going to be
03:03 rate for resting and heart rate.
03:07 And here what are we going to put?
03:09 Resting and heart rate, beats per minute
03:14 something like that. That's about as much space we have to work with.
03:17 So those are the labels that we saw.
03:19 The other thing we want is to have people input value.
03:22 So could get a single line text box
03:24 or a multi line text area.
03:27 We going to add Text Box.
03:28 Now, could rag it here
03:29 but what I want is to be next to this.
03:31 So check this out.
03:32 So I come over here and put it to the right
03:35 I drop it in the right place
03:37 and even move this little purple thing
03:39 to make more room or less room you know
03:41 so it's like 75%, text input
03:44 25% label and so on.
03:46 And let's connect here and give them some values.
03:48 So this going to be text box.
03:51 Not date, let's put this down one.
03:54 Let's put it there. Text Box, weight
04:00 and then we can give it a little placeholder right here.
04:04 This will just be, weight like that.
04:07 Then we have type equals text number, email
04:10 but text is actually what we want
04:11 actually numbers is what we want, isn't it?
04:13 So let's go set this to number
04:16 and I'll make another one of those
04:18 and we'll put it over here for the heartbeat.
04:30 Okay, I think we're doing pretty well.
04:31 We've got our weight set
04:33 we've got our heart rate set
04:34 and then I actually wanted a calendar for this first one.
04:38 So let's put that right here
04:42 and let's go set it's placeholder value too.
04:44 So not a date picker.
04:45 This is going to be, p of measurement or something like that.
04:51 Right, that looks pretty good.
04:52 Let's see how we're doing.
04:53 We'll run it on auto load
04:55 this is component for add measurement
04:56 We click here, We got our date
04:58 or we click on that date
05:00 or the Weight, set it to some values
05:02 not negative to this at 170
05:05 or whatever, hopes that the resting heart rates at 60
05:08 whatever happens to be
05:10 things like that.
05:11 So it looks like it's kind of working right?
05:13 I think that's a pretty good looking UI.
05:15 I got a few more things we need in our UI here
05:18 we're going to need a button
05:19 so let's put the button
05:22 as Outside, let's say Inside-Outside.
05:24 So your UI from when you're building it.
05:26 So this is going to be a Save button
05:29 which is going to be the Name.
05:30 But down here, it's going to be, Add Measurement
05:37 and again, let's put a little
05:39 cool little plus sign or something like that here.
05:42 so you want to add it
05:43 and I kind of like the colored inputs here.
05:46 So we can come down and set the role
05:48 to either primary or secondary for different colors.
05:51 I'll go with primary for now
05:54 and then finally, let's align that to the right
05:57 All right again, how we doing?
05:59 Hoo, it's looking pretty good.
06:01 I can click it.
06:02 And the last thing though is what if
06:04 I don't put weight here and I click it?
06:07 Right, you saw that there's this nice error message.
06:10 That's the last thing that we need to add here
06:11 so let's go to in here and put this error message like
06:13 even right in the way here so people know.
06:17 And let's make it super obvious.
06:19 Let's go, error message, like that.
06:22 For the name, Let's go
06:26 Error message, so we can see it more clearly.
06:29 Let's put it in the center make it bold
06:33 go down to the appearance
06:34 here we can set the foreground color
06:39 red's so harsh R-G-B, like that, make it red.
06:44 And then the last thing we want to do
06:46 is make it not visible by default.
06:49 Someone will run it by default
06:51 it's going to completely vanish from the UI
06:52 but if we click this
06:54 and something goes wrong, We're going to set the visibility, True
06:57 Set the Error message to what it is
07:00 Right, well, I think that pretty much does it for design
07:03 in the UI of our AddMeasurementComponent.
07:05 How cool is that!
07:06 like, you notice we can grab these
07:08 we can lay them out really nicely
07:10 put them side by side
07:11 we can even change the divider here
07:14 lot of cool stuff for that.
07:15 And for each one we have different class properties.
07:19 We also have different events
07:21 that we can click on down here and add
07:23 we don't really need to do any of those for these.
07:25 It's not like changing the date drive
07:26 some other part of the UI that we need to work with.
07:29 Right, but we will need an event for this one
07:31 which we'll get to.
07:33 That's the drag and drop way of building these forums.
07:35 And you can see it's really, really easy.
07:38 How much HTML Do we need to know?
07:41 None. How much CSS? Well, unless you count
07:44 knowing that, that hex code is red
07:49 we really didn't need to know very much at all.
07:50 Not that I'm saying knowing CSS is bad
07:53 knowing HTML is bad, I'm a web developer.
07:55 I love those things.
07:56 But it's certainly cool
07:57 that we can build this great looking UI
07:59 without having to know it.
