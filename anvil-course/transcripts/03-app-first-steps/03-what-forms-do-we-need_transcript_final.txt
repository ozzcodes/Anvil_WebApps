00:00 Now let's go ahead and create the rest of our forms.
00:03 And we're not quite there yet in terms
00:05 of writing the code, but I do want
00:06 to speak just a little bit about how the navigation
00:09 between these forms is going to work.
00:11 I did say that this is kind of like the top level
00:13 of our application.
00:15 One really important thing to do
00:17 or consider when you're writing web apps is
00:18 what is the overall look and feel?
00:20 You want the same navigation on the top
00:22 maybe even on the side.
00:23 A little footer on the bottom.
00:25 Kind of want the same thing all over
00:27 and then different content for the pages.
00:30 So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up
00:31 this form so we can take little sub forms
00:34 or components and dynamically replace them in here.
00:38 So we're going to have one form
00:39 that shows us our home view like
00:41 a history of our measurements
00:43 that we've saved in this as we've done work outs over time
00:46 or just measurements over time.
00:48 One that will show our account details
00:50 one that will let us add another measurement in here.
00:53 So we're going to dynamically swap those out.
00:54 So right now we're going to create this top level
00:56 material design form, we've already have.
00:59 But then the subsequent ones
01:01 these are going to be more blank ones
01:03 and they're just going to fill in a little gap here.
01:05 In fact let's go ahead and put that in here.
01:08 Put a little column panel in here
01:10 and we're going to give this a name.
01:11 This is going to be content or something like that, right.
01:15 Name it whatever you want.
01:16 We're going to dynamically replace that...
01:19 the value or the content of that
01:21 with these other forms.
01:24 Just to give us a sense of what kind
01:26 of forms we need to build.
01:27 Let's go ahead and add some hyper links over here.
01:30 Before we do that, if you look carefully it says to...
01:32 whoops, to put a column panel here.
01:35 And so this is a column panel.
01:38 Into the column panel we're going to put link one
01:43 link two, link three.
01:46 Those are not great names or values.
01:49 So suppose we have one that's going to take us home.
01:53 The text is going to be something like Home.
01:56 Over here, let me just type Home.
01:59 Another one we're going to want to add a measurement
02:02 so let's just say Add.
02:04 And we'll come up here and just say link_add.
02:07 Maybe add measurement we need to be more clear
02:10 and this one will be compare.
02:11 So you can compare yourself against other people in the app
02:15 stuff like that.
02:16 So this one down here is going to be compare.
02:20 Now we can add some little icons on top of this
02:22 while we're at it.
02:23 So if you're familiar with that, awesome.
02:25 And then that kind of thing.
02:26 So we come down here and say
02:28 I would want some kind of home.
02:30 If I choose that we have this little home thing there.
02:35 This one I want some kind of scale
02:37 so like, um
02:39 measurement right? To indicate measurement.
02:41 And for compare, what should we put?
02:43 Lets put a chart or something like that.
02:47 There we go.
02:48 So now we have this cool little thing going on.
02:50 Lets just take a quick look at that.
02:52 Alright so over here we got our little
02:54 hyperlinks with our stuff.
02:55 We're coming along well.
02:57 Alright that gives us a sense.
02:58 We're going to need a Home form
02:59 we're going to need a AddMeasurement form
03:01 and a Compare form.
03:03 The other thing that we need to do is
03:04 we're going to have somethings like registration
03:08 so come up here have Register.
03:11 Actually lets put it in this way.
03:12 Lets say you want to have an account
03:14 and view your account details.
03:15 Name Account and then the text is just going to be
03:19 Account like that.
03:21 We also want to have some other elements.
03:24 We're going to come up here and we're going to have like, logout.
03:27 So that's something you might see if you're logged in
03:30 these are like the two things...
03:33 You might have if you're logged in.
03:39 These are the two things you can do.
03:40 But if you're not logged in, you would have other operation.
03:42 Now we could make these kind of dual purpose
03:44 and change their text but it turns out in Anvil
03:46 its generally easier to have different things in show
03:50 and hide them depending on your circumstance.
03:52 So this would be register like so.
03:58 Then make the text register.
04:01 We're just going to hide the logged out ones
04:03 when you're logged in and vice versa.
04:07 Okay, so lets just run this real quick
04:08 and make sure everything's looking good.
04:10 Great, now were not hiding these yet.
04:12 We're going to, but we're not yet.
04:14 So were going to need a home form
04:15 an add measurement form and compare form
04:17 something to do show me your account
04:19 someway to login and register.
04:21 Turns out login and register are little dialogues
04:23 we don't have to write, they're provided by Anvil.
