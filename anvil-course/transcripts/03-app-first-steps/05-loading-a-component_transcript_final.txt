00:00 Well, our app is starting to come together.
00:01 We have some forms in place
00:03 these components that are going to dynamically
00:04 swap out what we're showing
00:06 and we have the overall look and feel in this home form.
00:09 Let's run it and see where we are.
00:11 Well, all the navigation bits are here
00:13 and what we don't have is, really
00:15 any content in this control thing we've got here
00:20 called a column panel content.
00:23 The idea is that as we interact with the app
00:25 we're going to load different things like, probably
00:27 that first thing in the anonymous bit
00:29 then you're login will show you this
00:30 and then you go in and add a measurement.
00:31 If you click that, we're going to load that one in there.
00:34 What I want to do, this is one of the more interesting forms
00:36 is going to show you how we work with this designer
00:39 and the code that handles the events
00:41 which is super interesting.
00:42 So, what I want to do is just start with loading this up
00:46 as if this was what we're going to do.
00:47 We'll talk about navigating
00:49 between these different components
00:51 and creating a navigational system later.
00:53 For now, let's just, somehow
00:55 have this appear right here when we launch our app.
00:59 And that brings us to a super interesting aspect of this.
01:03 You've probably already noticed it.
01:05 Over here we have our HomeForm
01:06 here's our designer
01:07 we have all of our elements we can drag on
01:09 and once we have an element selected
01:11 we can set its properties.
01:13 We also have events, down here when something happens
01:16 like button when it's clicked
01:17 we can have a function that's called.
01:19 But, notice up here, this design and this code.
01:24 We've only been working the design mode
01:26 and the UI design is really cool
01:27 but a lot of the magic happens here.
01:30 So, check this out. This is Python code.
01:32 It instantiates the form, the HTML
01:34 that's basically what this does
01:36 it sets all those properties you set in the designer
01:39 and then whatever code you want to write happens here.
01:42 So, button clicks, for example
01:44 will happen here and so on.
01:47 All right, I'll give you an example of that
01:48 so if we click on, let's say, add
01:51 make sure the names are right before you set this link add
01:54 because the method name is going to contain
01:57 part of the name here. So, that looks good.
01:59 If I double click this, notice it writes a function
02:01 and this code behind embed here that says
02:03 the link_add has been clicked
02:05 and this is what happens when the link gets clicked.
02:08 Now, what we're going to do is write the code
02:10 that gets the AddMeasurementComponent
02:13 and puts it into the shell that is our home form.
02:16 So, the way we're going to do that
02:17 is we're going to write some Python code.
02:19 We're going to say, from AddMeasurementComponent
02:23 that's this module right here
02:25 this is like a separate file.
02:27 But then, inside there
02:28 there's also a class named exactly the same thing.
02:30 So, we're going to write code like that.
02:32 Looks a bit funky, you'll get totally used to it.
02:34 That's just how it goes.
02:35 So, we're going to create a component
02:38 and we're just going to call the in it method
02:41 just create the class
02:42 just like you would in standard Python.
02:44 And then, over here, we're going to say self.
02:47 and check out all that stuff.
02:49 There's a whole bunch of cool things.
02:51 In fact, over here on the right
02:52 you can also see, you've got the column panel one
02:54 this is the one we have the navigation in
02:56 which, right, we should name it.
02:58 But, this is the one that really matters
02:59 and we can actually see stuff about it, right
03:01 all of its properties and so on.
03:04 This is really interesting, the beginning and the end
03:06 after a while, I'll find that I don't really use that window that much
03:08 but it's super nice to have it there.
03:09 So, we're going to say self.column_panel_content.clear.
03:14 And then, we're going to come over here and say Add Component
03:18 this AddMeasurementComponent.
03:20 Well, let's see how we've done.
03:23 Let's run it. All right, here it is.
03:25 We click this, it should clear out this part
03:28 there's nothing in here at the moment
03:29 but imagine we were on another view
03:31 this is going to add that form
03:32 we're going to have a better way
03:34 a more global factored way, a refactored way.
03:36 To do that, we're going to get in a later chapter
03:38 but for now, we just got to bootstrap the process
03:40 so we can build that form and see it. So, let's click.
03:43 Boom. Look at that. It doesn't look like much
03:46 but whatever we design in that add measurement component
03:50 is just going to show up
03:51 taking over the entire center of the screen here.
03:53 That's pretty awesome.
03:55 And, just so that we can get started a little bit easier
03:58 let's just write self.link_add_click, like so.
04:08 That way, when we run it
04:10 it should start up with the AddMeasurement form loaded.
04:14 See one other thing, you notice over on the left here
04:17 you don't see anything going on in terms of
04:21 it's not highlighted, showing us we're on this page.
04:24 We can do one final thing in this section.
04:26 We can say self link dot add role equals selected.
04:33 Here we go. Now, see it's got that gray, even if I don't hover over.
04:36 Okay, so we've loaded this up
04:37 and again we're going to take out that home bit
04:39 to load it on unload when we get a more
04:42 full-featured app written.
04:43 But I want to develop this AddMeasurement control component
04:46 because it shows you the most power
04:51 and most of the techniques you're going to need to know
04:52 how to build these components, these forms
04:55 and then add the event handlers
04:56 in all of those kinds of things.
04:58 Really cool. Looking forward to getting to it.
