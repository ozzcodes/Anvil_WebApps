00:00 You have the user interaction side of our little app built
00:03 but we also need to have the server side
00:06 with server communication built.
00:07 So it's going to be in several steps.
00:08 Actually, let's go up here and add
00:11 the bit to get the API key separate.
00:15 I'll pass in the data
00:17 and I'm going to create this here as well.
00:20 Let's just do it like this right here.
00:23 It's going to be a dict
00:24 and it's going to return an Optional of str
00:28 if you're familiar with this,
00:30 the typing thing that says it could be a string
00:31 or it could be nothing in case it failed.
00:34 So what we're going to do down here is
00:35 we're going to get email,
00:36 it's going to be data.get('email')
00:39 and same thing for password.
00:41 Now, it gets interesting.
00:42 Now we get to the server side bit
00:44 and maybe we'll refactor this into something nicer,
00:47 have a server side, piece, and a user interaction piece,
00:50 I would like that, but let's just keep rolling here for now.
00:53 So, we're going to use requests.
00:54 So we have to import requests up at the top.
00:57 and PyCharm luckily will do that for us
00:59 And then we need to do a post for a URL.
01:03 Save the json equals, something like that.
01:06 Those don't exist yet
01:08 we'll figure them out in a second.
01:09 Let's save the response to that
01:10 and we want to make sure the response succeeded
01:13 so there's a couple things we could do.
01:15 We could either just check the status code
01:17 or we could say resp.raise_for_status
01:20 if it's not 200 or 201,
01:22 this would cause an exception.
01:24 I think though, actually, what I want to do is say
01:26 something like this:
01:27 if not resp.status_code == 200
01:32 return None.
01:33 There's our optional bit.
01:35 Otherwise, we want to return resp.json
01:39 This will parse the body.
01:41 .get and what do we have?
01:43 API key I believe is what we're sending over.
01:47 All right, well that should pretty much do it
01:49 except we have to come up with the body.
01:51 So, body is going to be super easy.
01:55 Email. So that fixes body.
01:59 If I were able to put an equal sign there,
02:02 and colon there,
02:03 and then the other thing is URL is going to be
02:06 a base URL, remember that
02:08 plus authorize, I believe is what we called it.
02:11 Okay, so let's just check this part
02:15 and we also have to pass the API key in here
02:18 and just print API key.
02:20 Let's run this again.
02:21 See it before getting to the server
02:23 or actually getting this authentication here.
02:25 So Type this again. Moment of truth.
02:29 Well we actually probably should
02:31 do the authentication right away
02:32 but whatever.
02:33 This will still let us test it.
02:35 See it took a moment
02:37 and save measurement
02:39 is not written correctly.
02:40 Over here it expects
02:43 not an API key.
02:45 You know what that means?
02:46 That means awesome stuff
02:47 because it went past that line where it printed it out.
02:50 Look! We got our API key.
02:52 We logged in! Yes! It worked!
02:55 I think there's a couple things we need to do.
02:57 Let's put this at the top here
03:00 and let's say this is auth_data = get_auth_data().
03:05 And we'll pass that over like this
03:07 and then this one, we need to tell it to do less.
03:10 So let's go here and let's ask like that,
03:27 There we go. So we can factor getting the email
03:30 and the password in one step.
03:32 Getting the other information here,
03:34 that let's us do the authentication
03:36 and we're going to say if not api_key
03:39 and bail out early.
03:41 So let's do this one more time,
03:42 just to make sure this is working.
03:47 All right let me put something bad in here
03:50 invalid login, exit, all right.
03:51 Let me put in something correct this time
03:55 Perfect! We logged in, we're ready.
03:58 Now we can go enter our heart rate which is 71
04:02 whatever, something like that.
04:04 It worked. Looks like our interaction
04:06 and our little login even printed out later
04:09 In the flow we printed this out.
04:11 So I feel like getting the login and getting the user,
04:14 the API key is actually what we need.
04:16 This is totally working.
