00:00 I've built a couple e-commerce websites over the years
00:03 and there are really hard ways to do it
00:04 and quite easy ways to do it.
00:07 A hard way is to work with some ancient e-commerce API
00:11 from some bank's merchant account
00:13 and they're just really crummy, hard to work with.
00:16 And then you've got to handle all the flow, all the forms
00:19 and validation and all of that stuff
00:20 and all the edged cases in your Web app.
00:23 Another way to do it, is to use something modern
00:26 and clean and simple like Stripe.
00:28 And so, what we're going to do
00:29 and what Anvil has done and supported
00:31 is allow us to use something called Stripe Checkout.
00:35 If you've taken any of our paid courses
00:38 you will know what this looks like.
00:39 So come over here, here's are site
00:41 and see that blue button
00:43 buy now, get lifetime access for $49?
00:46 If you click this, what happens is
00:48 something pops up that looks just like that.
00:51 Our Python, here's our icon
00:53 lifetime access to the course $49.
00:56 You enter your email, your credit card number
00:58 expiration and CVV date or CVV code
01:01 and then you hit pay.
01:02 In the bottom left, see how it says powered by Stripe.
01:07 This is what we're going to add to our application.
01:10 We're going to add the ability to have this dialogue come.
01:13 And when we actually hit the pay $49 here
01:16 what's going to happen is, there's going to be some code run
01:19 over on Anvil as a response.
01:20 Now, on this one it actually does a post back
01:23 and loads up a different page.
01:25 The way Anvil's done it
01:26 they've kind of taken care of that.
01:27 So it's even simpler than pure Stripe Checkout
01:31 which is great.
