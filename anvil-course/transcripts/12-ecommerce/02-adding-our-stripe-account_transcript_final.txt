00:00 Here we are in our Anvil app
00:01 and we want to add Stripe checkout for when we click
00:04 this button we charge $9.99.
00:07 In order to do that we have to add the Stripe service.
00:10 We have users, Google API for login data tables
00:14 now we're going to need to add Stripe down here.
00:16 In order to use this you're going to have
00:18 to have a Stripe account.
00:20 You don't technically, in the early testing have
00:23 to have a bank account or anything that will make
00:26 information linked to that Stripe account.
00:29 Just have to create it.
00:30 So I've created a separate test Stripe account I'm
00:34 going to use here that is not tied
00:36 to my business Stripe account.
00:38 I don't actually want those things anywhere near
00:40 each other so I'm going to do a quick login
00:42 and then we'll carry on.
00:43 So either you create an account or you login
00:47 with an existing account. Perfect, so I've logged in, no big deal to that.
00:49 Just click the add my current account, went over
00:53 through OAuth and logged in at Stripe and
00:56 then it came back here.
00:58 Now it says we're in test mode and absolutely
01:00 we want to be in test mode we don't want to have actual
01:03 charges attempted here and stuff.
01:05 There's actually a bunch of test credit cards that
01:07 signify different scenarios.
01:10 What does it look like if I want
01:12 to have a successful charge?
01:13 What if I want to have an invalid CVV?
01:15 What if I wanted to have an expired card
01:17 declined payment, a fraudulent card?
01:19 All those kinds of things.
01:20 Go in test mode we can test that and then flip
01:22 it to live if we were a real app.
01:25 This is just a demo so we're never ever going to do that.
01:28 Anyway it shows us that the code down here is pretty simple.
01:32 So we got to do that and then we'll be in good shape.
01:37 So this is our first step here to do what we want
01:41 with Stripe is to just have this connected
01:43 the service added, and we're going to use this code
01:46 so I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste
01:49 and edit it because it's exactly what we want.
