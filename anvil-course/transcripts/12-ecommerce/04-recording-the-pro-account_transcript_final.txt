00:00 So the next thing we to do is switch this user account
00:03 into actually being a pro.
00:04 We saw that if we click this and we make them a pro
00:08 it still just says that they're basic.
00:10 And that's because we're taking their money
00:11 yay, that's fun
00:13 but we're not actually changing their account.
00:17 Down here, instead of doing yay, you're a pro
00:19 we need to do something.
00:20 Let's go to this data access
00:24 and say go pro.
00:27 That's not a thing yet, but it's going to be.
00:29 So over here
00:30 this is where we've been hiding away all
00:31 of our interaction with the server, right?
00:34 Here's how we get our averages, set our details and so on.
00:37 So let's just do something real similar.
00:41 Here. Like this. So, we want the user.
00:48 It's what we're going to work with.
00:51 And what we need to do is we need to go
00:53 and make a change over on the server.
00:58 We look at our data table here
01:00 and the user service
01:01 they have an is pro, true or false?
01:04 Right, so what we need to do is set that to true.
01:09 But because we're setting it to true
01:10 this user is being cached, right?
01:13 We got a big performance boost from doing this here
01:17 where we automatically cache it
01:19 and only get a new bit of information from the server
01:22 if it's not here.
01:23 So we need to set this to none
01:26 so that next time someone asks for the user
01:29 they have to go over to the account, pull it down
01:32 and they'll see that it has a new value for its pro.
01:35 So we'll say go pro here.
01:37 Going to be something on the server side
01:39 remember the management service data side is the only thing
01:42 that has access to write against the database
01:46 which is appropriate.
01:53 So then we're going to do this.
01:59 And get the user, for some reason if there's no user
02:02 I don't know what to do about this, we can't fix it.
02:04 This is pretty hard, I want to say is pro equals true.
02:09 Done.
02:10 We've implemented the server side, that's pretty sweet.
02:12 Let's see, let's work our way back
02:14 we go to data_access.
02:15 We're calling go pro and we're refreshing
02:18 or knocking out the user there.
02:20 We got to work our way back here to the account page.
02:23 One thing that we could do is we could change the UI around
02:27 so now it says pro in the account type
02:31 and it says, you know, hides that button.
02:33 We could also just reload this page
02:35 which I think is probably the right thing to do.
02:37 And so let's just go up here and import navigation.
02:43 It'll reload itself, it'll recompute.
02:46 You know, is the user a pro
02:47 and all this stuff will rerun again
02:48 so that's probably best, I'm going to go with that.
02:51 Go account, boom.
02:54 So let's refresh the page basically and we'll be good.
02:57 Go to the database, record that, they are a pro.
03:01 In reality, I would also record some of the details
03:03 about this charge. That they attempted it
03:05 that it either succeeded or failed.
03:07 You want to have some record of people trying
03:09 to do e-commerce stuff on your site.
03:12 That would be a separate data table.
03:14 We're not going to do it, 'cause it's not real, but, you know.
03:16 Auditing in a real app around accounting
03:19 and credit cards is a good idea.
03:22 All right, are we ready to pros?
03:23 I'm feeling like a pro already.
03:25 So here we go.
03:27 I come over here, I want to be a pro.
03:29 Cancel, actually no.
03:31 I want to be a pro, let's go pro again.
03:33 Put my email address, do my four twos.
03:36 All right, so what this should do is it should go
03:38 make the charge, that should succeed
03:40 'cause this number, this credit card is valid
03:42 and then it's going to go to the server
03:44 and tell account that it is pro.
03:46 It's going to reload the page
03:47 which should make this button go away
03:48 and make that text go to pro.
03:50 Ready? Here we go.
03:54 Boom. Yeah, that purchase canceled
03:57 I need to hide that, don't I?
03:59 All right, cool.
04:00 I guess that was already there
04:01 from the first time I hit it
04:02 but yeah, perfect, this looks great.
04:05 So now our account is pro
04:06 if we go and look at the account
04:08 of course it should be also a pro over here.
04:13 And our users, and sure enough, there it is.
04:17 I guess one super small improvement we could make is
04:24 when I hit that, it kind of looked weird
04:27 that it was left over from before.
04:30 So let's, whenever they click that button
04:32 first thing, the label goes away.
04:35 So while Stripe is thinking and the server is thinking
04:37 we're not going to have some kind of remnant error
04:40 that might freak people out.
04:41 I think we're good.
04:43 How many lines is this?
04:44 This is like 22 lines of code.
04:47 Over here.
04:49 Probably another four or five over here
04:54 another five or six.
04:57 That's it for our e-commerce
04:58 and in like 60 lines of code
05:00 we just added e-commerce support to our site.
05:03 And we also want to send them an email probably
05:05 with a receipt and all this kind of stuff.
05:06 There's, like, real e-commerce is a little more complicated.
05:09 But that was pretty quick and easy and, yeah
05:13 I use Stripe checkout for my business all the time.
05:16 I think it's great, so definitely recommend
05:18 that you give it a try.
