00:00 The next step to complete are compare yourself
00:02 to the average person of your height and gender
00:05 is to load up a bunch of averages.
00:08 You know, if you are this height and this gender
00:10 here are your average heart rates
00:12 and average weights and so on.
00:15 I've already dropped in an app here.
00:17 It's very similar to the Fitnessd client
00:20 at least the terminal command line version of it.
00:23 So this is in the GitHub Repo for you to work with.
00:26 But let's go and have a quick look.
00:28 I guess we could clean up some things here.
00:31 So what it's going to do is it's going to go to the service
00:33 and see if the averages exist and not re-upload them
00:37 because then we'd end up with weird duplicates.
00:39 And then it's going to load some CSV data.
00:41 So if you look over here, I've just going to the internet
00:43 and found some probably highly inaccurate
00:46 or at least maybe tilted data around gender and height
00:51 and heart rates and things like this.
00:54 Oh, it just says height and weight.
00:55 They're just height and weight over here.
00:57 And then we're going to take
00:59 we have 10000 rows of this
01:01 and then we're going to process it
01:02 and come up with averages.
01:03 If you're 71 point something inches tall
01:07 then this is the average weight of these measurements.
01:10 If you're 72, and so on.
01:12 And then we're going to upload those really simply here.
01:15 It's using the same authentication mechanism as before.
01:19 Here's where it's computing the averages.
01:20 And then we just did to not upload some when we're testing.
01:24 This is kind of useless line now.
01:26 We're going to go and upload those to the service
01:29 and what we've done is we've added another load average
01:34 function over an .
01:35 So let's look at that real quick.
01:38 So down here, we have a data loader service
01:41 and I've moved the authentication step
01:43 that we wrote before from management
01:45 sorry from the API, over into the separate modules
01:47 so that data loader in API can use it.
01:50 And we're just going to upload a bunch of weights
01:53 heights, genders and heart rate information and save that
01:56 as an average, as I've described before.
01:59 There won't be too many of them.
02:00 Once we average out, it's like 40-some, 41
02:03 something like this.
02:04 We also want to know are there any averages.
02:08 Right, so what you're going to do is we're actually on that
02:11 compare page only show the compare results
02:14 if I even attempt to continue if there are some averages
02:18 uploaded, okay.
02:19 So if we run it now, then we go to compare
02:23 it says, sorry, you don't have any information about
02:25 a male who's five feet 11.
02:28 Actually I've done a little bit more work
02:30 to work with these API end points here
02:34 in this compare 'cause not a lot of sense for you
02:37 watching me do this the whole time.
02:38 So let's just a quick look.
02:41 So it comes in and it's going to ask for
02:44 your averages and let's see what else does it
02:47 Use this count thing.
02:48 So what it's going to do is it's going to ask for your average.
02:51 This is a function on the server side that says
02:54 I'm this tall, I'm this gender.
02:56 Do you have an average for me
02:57 'cause maybe, you know like I said
02:58 we're just randomly grabbing a bunch of measurements
03:00 and turning those into averages.
03:02 So we might not have one for you
03:04 which would be unfortunate
03:05 and you might, may or may not have measurements
03:07 so if you have measurements in an average
03:09 then we're going to build this out here.
03:13 And we're going to hide and show these cards.
03:15 I also added two little quick functions
03:17 the computer a foot statement
03:20 so, like, five feet 11 inches out of just pure inches
03:24 71 inches for example.
03:25 And then computing the sign
03:27 so we want to show you're five pounds heavier
03:31 or five pounds lighter than the average person
03:33 of your height.
03:35 And I just want to reiterate this data is super sketchy
03:38 and please don't take any of this as, like, accurate
03:41 like look at real medical data and stuff
03:43 if you care about this.
03:44 This is just a silly example and we just need some data
03:46 that kind of sort of works.
03:47 That's where that is.
03:49 We're going to run this application here to upload it
03:53 all right, and we've already gone through
03:56 building this application before
03:57 so we don't need to do it again, right.
03:59 We basically did this with our interactive
04:02 our fake mobile app or whatever.
04:05 Okay, so I'm just going to run this and we'll see what we get.
04:08 So it's running.
04:09 It found no data on the server, so it's going to load it.
04:12 It loaded 10000 entries.
04:15 It then computed 41 averages
04:18 by averaging that data
04:20 and then it is uploading stuff
04:22 so we'll give that a second.
04:24 We don't have any data on heart rate
04:26 so I just said, well, the rate is 80.
04:28 I don't even know if that's good or not
04:32 and it probably varies from male to female
04:33 but it's 80.
04:34 It doesn't really mean anything. We just need a number there.
04:35 All that data is uploaded.
04:36 If we go over here and we go back to our data tables
04:41 we should have data in our averages table.
04:45 Here you go!
04:46 We have a bunch of stuff on males
04:47 a bunch of stuff on females
04:48 and their heights and then their weights and so on.
04:51 Again, super sketchy data
04:52 but here it is.
04:54 So for the grand finale
04:55 let's run this and we'll see over here
05:00 in this compare, it's going to go and do a filter
05:04 for this height, this gender, and so on.
05:07 You get an average.
05:08 It's going to take your latest measurement
05:10 and it is going to...
05:12 Here's your latest measurement.
05:14 And it's going to set the average as far as it's concerned
05:17 average weight, and it's going to compute your weight
05:18 and the change relative to the average
05:21 and it'll put a plus or minus and then the value.
05:24 So let's run that see what we get.
05:25 All right, let's compare. Compare me. Alright.
05:29 The average person my size, their weight is 201.9.
05:32 Their heart rate, surprise, is 80 beats per minute.
05:35 I weigh, according to my last measurement, 181
05:39 which is 21 pounds less than average
05:42 and my heart rate was 74, which is 6 beats per minute
05:46 less than average.
05:47 Again, contrived data, semi-contrived.
05:50 I did get it from somewhere but I don't know
05:52 how representative it is.
05:53 Anyway, here's our cool little compare ourself.
05:56 And we were able to use our API and some scripts
05:59 to load up that data and to compute that data.
06:01 And I think that's a really cool aspect of it as well.
06:04 This should be it for our UI.
06:06 We've got home. We've got add.
06:10 We've got compare. We've got our account.
06:13 Now, we haven't the go_pro part
06:14 but that's going to be the e-commerce stuff.
06:16 And then if we log out, finally we have
06:19 this unauthenticated home page
06:21 and then you try to go anywhere, it just says login.
06:24 Okay, that's it. The UI for our app is done.
