00:00 All right, let's quickly use
00:01 this set height and gender thing.
00:03 I've even also added a little drop-down
00:05 which is cool, we haven't seen that before.
00:07 So we're going to implement something
00:09 that happens when we click on this.
00:12 And what we're going to do is
00:13 we're going to gather up the details that we have over here.
00:17 We want to get the height in inches, so we'll say self.
00:23 let's just say height equals self.
00:27 have a little textbox.text
00:31 and that's going to come in as a string
00:32 so we've got to convert that to an integer.
00:35 Perfect, and we have gender
00:37 is equal to self.dropdown
00:42 selected value.
00:45 And we could always do a little validation here.
00:47 We'll say, if not one of these, like
00:50 let's go if not this.
00:55 self.error message, label_error_message, sorry
00:58 label_error.text equals
01:02 you must set your height.
01:05 And this one's a little different because when it runs
01:08 it's automatically going to have select your gender.
01:11 So over here we'll say self.dropdown_gender.selected_value.
01:16 If that's equal to self.dropdown.items
01:20 of zero, which is the first one
01:22 you must set your gender.
01:26 All right so that's a good start.
01:28 And in order to test that, let's go into the navigation
01:30 and before we go to our account
01:34 let's say if not user, what are we looking for?
01:37 Gender, that'll work.
01:41 Go set details, something like that, then hit return.
01:45 So this we haven't written yet.
01:51 Set the active nav to None.
01:54 Set title to None.
02:00 And then we'll do something much like this.
02:03 And up at the top, we again have to import one last time
02:06 from sent height component.
02:09 Maybe I should rename that to details
02:11 but I'm just going to leave it like this for now.
02:17 There, like that.
02:20 Okay, I think that'll do it here.
02:22 And we also need to add that in compare
02:25 in case they try to go to compare.
02:31 Perfect, let's give that a try.
02:35 Alright, here we are.
02:36 If we try to go to our account
02:37 it's going to take us here, that's cool.
02:39 Let's go back. Try to go to compare also
02:42 because these details are not set.
02:45 Super, so now this page is showing up.
02:46 If we try to say save, you must set your height.
02:50 Whatever, that's not really height.
02:52 Must set our gender, okay cool.
02:54 If we pick this, the error doesn't go away.
02:57 We just do the work and actually leave.
02:59 So we don't need to worry about that.
03:01 Now the last thing here is
03:03 what happens when this actually succeeds, right?
03:06 We get to this part, and just like before
03:08 we want to make sure we refresh the user
03:10 and we're going to talk to the server.
03:12 So that was our data access we're using everywhere else.
03:17 Let's say set details height and gender.
03:25 And up here, we need to import that stuff.
03:27 There's a bunch of things we don't need.
03:32 Cool, now let's go over to data access
03:34 and write one more function that's going to be
03:37 very similar to the one right above it.
03:41 So all we have to do is go and call server here
03:46 a server thing, and it's going to be set details
03:50 doesn't exist yet, but what we're going to pass it
03:53 is height and gender.
03:56 And the other thing we need to do is just wipe out the user.
04:00 So we're going to go over here.
04:02 And we're not going to log them out, necessarily.
04:06 I guess we could just call a logout, but I don't know.
04:09 I'm just going to set it to be none
04:10 and we need that to be global.
04:13 The reason is, we need to get the user again from the server
04:17 because these details are going to be set on it.
04:20 All right, so let's go and do that.
04:23 The last bit is just going to be a real simple thing
04:25 over on the server side.
04:26 Remember, we don't have direct access to this.
04:30 Here we have set details and we're going to have
04:33 what order, this order has to be consistent.
04:36 Height and gender.
04:41 All right, height and gender.
04:42 We're going to get the user.
04:44 Let's just raise.
04:48 Must be logged in. Okay, so that's going to require that we do that.
04:50 Now here, this is going to be really easy.
04:52 We're going to say user set to gender, equal to gender.
04:57 And user height equals to height.
05:03 And I'll just say return, there we go.
05:06 Perfect, so this is all we should need to do.
05:09 Let's make sure that this works.
05:10 We will take it through it's paces real quick.
05:15 All right, so over here, so over here
05:17 let's try to go to our account page.
05:19 Says no, no, no, we can't show you that just yet.
05:21 I have to set your height and so on.
05:24 And for me that is 71 and I come over here
05:28 and use my dropdown and say I'm a guy.
05:31 When I click this, it should go to the server
05:33 and set those details.
05:35 And then, well, let's see what happens.
05:37 If it goes anywhere, I think it'll take us
05:39 back to our account, we'll find out.
05:41 So the details have been set.
05:42 We should do a redirect, which apparently we didn't.
05:44 But if we go home and then back.
05:47 Check it out, it's set.
05:49 We've got to fix that redirect really quick
05:51 but look how cool that is.
05:52 My details are now set.
05:55 So quickly, we forgot a quick redirect here.
05:59 Now we need navigation as well.
06:08 I'm going to say go to your account.
06:10 I guess we could pass it and somehow
06:11 whether or not you go to the account or back to compare
06:14 I'm just going to, just go like this.
06:16 This will be good enough
06:18 for what we've got going on I suppose.
06:20 Okay, so this is going to take us to home.
06:21 I can't really test it again because my details are set.
06:24 I guess I could erase them, but it seems like
06:26 that's going to be just fine.
06:28 All right, so now our account page
06:30 after a little diversion there, is working.
