00:00 It's super fun to build a website
00:02 but if only you get to use it, how much fun is it really?
00:05 Obviously, we typically build websites
00:08 for a whole bunch of people.
00:10 In our wildest dreams, maybe millions of people.
00:12 But the first step in order to getting our app available
00:16 to anyone else is to give it a domain
00:18 make it available to people.
00:20 So there's a couple of options that we have.
00:23 We saw that we could already host our app
00:25 on that funky fresh fruit song
00:28 or something like that, domain, .anvil.app.
00:31 And that's fine, that's a pretty good public option.
00:34 But if you're really going to build a site
00:36 and make it professional
00:37 especially if you're going to do something like e-commerce
00:39 as we'll talk about soon
00:41 you definitely want it to be on its own domain.
00:44 So here's our app, but notice this time
00:47 there's a couple of really sweet things going on.
00:50 One, it has HTTPS, it's encrypted.
00:52 And two, it's on its own domain.
00:55 Now, I decided to make this a sub domain of talkpython.com
00:58 just so that I don't have to deal
01:00 with creating another domain and paying for it
01:03 year after year to keep it around.
01:05 It's easy to add it just as an extra sub domain
01:08 health, for talk python.
01:09 In our demo, we're actually going to use fitnessd
01:11 as in what you see right here, fitness, fitnessd
01:14 as the sub domain there.
01:16 But okay, so this is our goal of this chapter.
01:19 To get the Anvil app that we built up here
01:21 and running like this.
01:23 You'll see it's not too hard.
01:24 It does take a little bit of patience
01:26 because, well, DNS takes time.
01:28 There's some Let's Encrypt HTTPS certificates
01:31 that take a little bit of time, things like that.
01:33 But it's not hard and we'll do it right away.
