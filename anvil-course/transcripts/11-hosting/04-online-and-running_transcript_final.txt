00:00 Well, I've tried to refresh this page
00:02 over the last 45 minutes, close to an hour
00:06 and it hasn't been there yet.
00:07 But I have reason to believe
00:09 that finally the HTTP certificate, HTTPS certificate
00:13 SSL certificate, has been generated and everything
00:16 all the automated systems have kicked in
00:18 over on the Anvil side
00:19 so let's refresh this and see what we get.
00:23 Ta-da, there it is!
00:24 Awesome, here is our application, and it's working.
00:27 We can go over here and we can log into it.
00:31 Tell it to remember us, here we are logged in.
00:34 Again, this is running against the same data, the same app
00:37 it just happens to be hosted on a new domain.
00:39 So all the measurements
00:40 and stuff we've already put there are in.
00:43 We don't have any information to compare ourselves yet
00:45 but that's okay, we can go and just go
00:48 and add another one of these, another measurement.
00:51 Let's do 182, let's do 20
00:53 20 is just going to mess up our graph.
00:55 Let's put 74, 182 and 74.
01:01 And there it is, 182 and 74
01:03 that's our new set of measurements
01:05 but running over our own domain using encryption.
01:11 And just to round things out
01:13 that encryption is via Let's Encrypt.
01:16 You don't really care, Anvil takes care of that for you
01:18 but it's just a kind of bit of a curiosity there.
01:21 All right, we've hosted our app.
01:23 That's a really good step.
