00:00 Here we are at the DNS settings for talkpython.com.
00:03 It's at GoDaddy, I actually really dislike GoDaddy
00:06 as a company, but it's been around there so long
00:08 I just don't want to transfer it away and deal with
00:10 the consequence of possibly messing that up or the downtime
00:13 so it's staying there.
00:14 Our new domains I'm getting at domains.google.com
00:17 I like them a lot. But, here it is.
00:19 So, I'm going to use this, and we're just going
00:21 to add a name server.
00:23 The host is going to be fitnessd, and it's going to point
00:27 to that location that I already copied.
00:30 Time to live, let's make this as short as possible
00:33 'cause we're going to be possibly messing with it.
00:35 So, here we go. Well, it's done.
00:39 And here's where the patience comes in.
00:42 So, just going to wait a couple of seconds
00:45 to make sure that this works and then we'll see.
00:49 So, here's a good way to start.
00:51 Thing is, if you rush this too much
00:52 then you're going to get it cached locally
00:55 somewhere in the chain along the way
00:57 and your system, either in your local OS's DNS lookup
01:02 or maybe in your router, or maybe your ISP
01:06 but, we'll try.
01:10 All right, moment of truth, is the DNS ready?
01:12 Probably, let's give it a shot.
01:14 Aw, sweet, it's working.
01:17 Okay, so there's a chance that Anvil is ready.
01:21 Let's go back over here
01:24 and let's try going like that.
01:27 Aw. Now, I'm glad I ran into it.
01:29 I'm not glad this is here
01:31 but I'm glad I ran into this.
01:33 So, what's going on?
01:35 So if we look here you can see more information
01:39 about this certificate somewhere
01:44 maybe, maybe it's not pulling it down.
01:46 So, here's the deal though
01:47 let me take a step back.
01:50 So when we go to things like
01:53 fresh-zealous-song.anvil.app
01:56 and we look at the certificate
01:58 we'll see it's created by Let's Encrypt.
02:00 Let's Encrypt is awesome.
02:01 You can automate creating free SSL certificates.
02:05 And, just by the way
02:08 we go over here and look at this
02:10 similar, right, same thing.
02:12 Over here what we saw was we have this
02:15 if we look at more information
02:17 here, View Certificates, that's what I was looking for
02:20 and see that it's for *.anvil.app.
02:24 That's why when we go to this other view
02:29 here, where it's not .anvil.app
02:33 we're not seeing something nice, like SSL-encrypted
02:36 what we're instead seeing is that it's not ready.
02:39 Here's the process.
02:40 I told you it takes patience but it is easy.
02:43 The first part is we had to wait on
02:45 our DNS provider to update
02:47 so that fitnessd.talkpython.com resolved to something.
02:52 That was pretty quick.
02:54 The next thing we have to do is actually wait a little bit
02:57 for Anvil to run some automated scripts that go out
03:01 to Let's Encrypt and generate a certificate
03:04 for that domain for us.
