00:00 Well, here's our app, and we saw that
00:01 we could press run on it and that's pretty cool.
00:04 We get this URL up here
00:06 if you try to go to that URL in a private browser
00:10 well, what do we get? Sign in.
00:13 This is not the experience we want
00:14 we don't want to share our login to Anvil, obviously.
00:17 Well, we've done some work already as part of that API step
00:21 and we said publish the app
00:22 and we said we want to use fresh-zealous-song.anvil.app
00:26 That first part was auto generated
00:29 and this actually works.
00:31 This is pretty good
00:32 we have HTPS, we have a domain
00:34 we could even login over here.
00:38 Now we're logged in, here's our help history
00:40 works like a charm.
00:41 Okay, however if you really want to build your own product
00:45 you don't want to depend on Anvil's domain
00:48 you wanted to identify you out there.
00:50 This is fine for little utility apps
00:52 maybe even you share within your company
00:54 things like that
00:55 but if you want to have a public website you need a domain.
00:58 So that's what we going to do here
01:01 and you come down here and click
01:02 add a custom domain
01:06 and like I said what I'm going to use is Fitnessd, like fitnessd
01:09 that's the name of our app .talkpython
01:12 My main site is .fm, but I'm going to use .com.
01:15 I have both domains
01:16 really rather not mess with the
01:18 talk.python.fm domain really at all
01:21 and notice here it says we're going to
01:22 create an A record and we're going to enter
01:26 Fitnessd for the pattern or whatever
01:30 and then we're going to enter that as the
01:32 place to map it to.
01:33 And they have a little guide here on how that works.
01:36 So I'm going to flip over to my domain provider
01:39 quickly run through these steps
01:41 and then we're going to come back
01:42 and have a look at what happened.
