00:00 What fun would our app be
00:01 where we are going to store things like measurements
00:05 over time and personalized information
00:08 without having some kind of account?
00:10 Luckily, Anvil makes it super easy for us
00:13 to create accounts, log in with username and password
00:16 or even things like using your Google account
00:18 or other accounts like that, even Enterprise accounts.
00:21 And it makes sure that it happens in a nice and secure way.
00:25 Creating basic accounts is tricky.
00:27 We got to make sure we store the password correctly.
00:29 And oh, what if they've got to reset their password?
00:31 Now we have to be able to send email.
00:32 There's all sorts of stuff around
00:34 user management and accounts.
00:35 It turns out to be pretty tricky
00:37 in from scratch web applications
00:39 that Anvil's going to handle for us.
00:42 All of this starts with the User Service.
00:45 When you create a new project
00:46 it doesn't have a User Service.
00:47 But, there's a Services section
00:49 and you just add the User Service
00:50 and configure it as you want.
00:52 So you'll see, we're going to go over there
00:53 and we're going to click on the User Service
00:55 and add it to our application.
00:57 Then we get to pick how users can interact with our site.
01:01 How do we want them to log in?
01:02 We can say only active directory
01:04 which is a way to basically have a single account
01:07 within your company, managed by your company.
01:10 We could have the traditional username or password.
01:13 We could have sign in with Google or Facebook, certificates.
01:16 We could actually do all of these things
01:17 if we had the Enterprise plan.
01:19 So here you can see, we can configure whether
01:21 you could be remembered across sessions
01:23 how long that should be for, and so on.
01:26 So all this stuff we have to do to have
01:27 a nice user interaction, Anvil just makes it a checkbox.
01:31 That's what we're going to do in this chapter
01:33 is we're going to configure this
01:34 and then integrate it into our application.
01:36 You can see the little sample code at the top
01:38 anvil.users.login with form.
01:41 That's a pretty simple way to get started
01:42 and I think we'll start there.
