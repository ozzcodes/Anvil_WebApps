00:00 We saw we can register
00:02 and we saw we can drive the user interface
00:04 based on whether or not there is a user
00:06 even from remembering us from session to session, right?
00:09 So if I run this now
00:11 we'll see that account and logout are shown
00:13 but that login and register are not.
00:16 However, we probably want to let them log out
00:19 at some point, right?
00:20 So let's go do that, that turns out to be super, super easy.
00:23 So when you go down here and you click this
00:25 you see Anvil.users.logout.
00:31 Not too hard, huh?
00:32 And we also want to go back home and set this user state.
00:38 Okay, so we're going to go do those three things.
00:41 I'm going to log out
00:42 and then we want to set this to be None
00:45 because we've logged them out
00:47 and then we're going to go home
00:48 that's going to trigger a refresh
00:50 of potentially that home screen
00:52 and show the anonymous view.
00:54 if you're on the home screen, of course
00:55 it's just going to toggle that
00:56 but if you were maybe somewhere else
00:57 like in your account page
00:58 got to take 'em somewhere that's valid
01:00 and home is always valid.
01:02 Let's run that.
01:03 All right, we're logged in, as you can see right here.
01:06 I click logout, it should change this menu.
01:09 Should re-navigate us home
01:10 which is going to reload this to home anonymous view.
01:13 Let's give it a shot, here we go. Again, the cell.
01:18 All right, let's try it one more time.
01:20 Well, our logout worked.
01:21 We just weren't able to update.
