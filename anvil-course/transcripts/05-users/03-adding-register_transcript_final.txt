00:00 With our user service set up
00:01 let's go back to our HomeForm here
00:04 and work on register.
00:06 So if somebody comes in here and clicks register
00:08 we want to show them a form, gather their information
00:11 create an account and then set a cookie potentially
00:13 to remember across at least this session.
00:17 We're going to do that, and then once we have the ability
00:19 to create accounts, we'll be able to later
00:21 log in and log out of those accounts.
00:24 So here's our register, click handler
00:26 and turn out if we go way to the top
00:28 we have anvil.users, and this is the thing
00:31 that we're going to use, to actually interact with it
00:34 so let's go back down here, our register
00:37 and we say anvil.users.signup_with_form.
00:43 You can say sign up with just email, just Google
00:45 or whatever.
00:46 We're just going to say sign up with form
00:48 and we're just going to run it for a second
00:50 and show you something that's kind of annoying.
00:51 We don't need a pass here.
00:53 Once you do this we maybe want to refresh
00:55 and send you back home, say go home.
00:59 Now that we have accounts, what we want to do
01:01 when you go home, is to, let me load up this HomeForm here.
01:05 Let's say that's over here.
01:07 We want to check and determine whether or not
01:10 there is an account.
01:11 If there is an account, show the anonymous component here
01:15 or just hey welcome to our app, you should sign in
01:17 create an account.
01:18 Or, the one that is the details
01:21 hey welcome to your account, here are your details.
01:24 So we're going to deal with that in just a second.
01:25 Let's take it one thing at a time
01:26 but it turns out to be pretty easy.
01:28 So down here, we going to go and register
01:31 and then we're going to go back home.
01:33 Just to refresh the screen here.
01:35 Let's go ahead and run this.
01:37 So we're on our anonymous page
01:38 if we click register, now all of a sudden
01:40 we get this cool signup.
01:42 So we can sign up with an email
01:45 or we can sign up with Google.
01:47 Now, how do I decide that I didn't like that form?
01:52 Huh, well it turns out if for some reason
01:55 you click that and you don't actually want to register
01:58 to bad, you've got to refresh the page.
01:59 So let's go fix that really quick.
02:01 That's kind of annoying but I wanted to show you that
02:03 so we have this allow_cancel is True
02:06 and now if we run it, it's probably the right experience
02:09 that we're looking for. So click here, and sign up with email or with Google
02:12 or you know what, actually never mind, forget it.
02:16 So we're going to go over here and we're going to sign up.
02:19 We just going to sign up with a simple email.
02:22 No problem there, and say remember me.
02:23 So we'll say sign up.
02:26 Give this just a second, and it went home.
02:28 We got some output over here.
02:31 So it automatically created some columns in that table
02:34 which didn't exist before right
02:36 so it basically created that table over in the user
02:38 service, and now you should be logged in.
02:42 Our app didn't understand that.
02:44 It do anything. So, that's okay though.
02:47 We've already signed up.
02:48 Let's see what else we can do here.
02:50 We can also say remember by default, that is true
02:52 but you could disable that if you want.
02:55 Last thing, let's see if our user actually got created here.
02:59 We go to our data tables.
03:00 Look at that, there's a michael@talkpython.fm.
03:04 This account is enabled, is_pro is unset.
03:07 But check this out, we have a nice password hash here.
03:10 We have the remember login details that have been set
03:14 and the last time that we logged in.
03:17 Super cool huh?
03:18 So really really great to be able to just check
03:20 a few boxes, call a simple function, and have Envol
03:23 handle all the tricky user management stuff for us.
