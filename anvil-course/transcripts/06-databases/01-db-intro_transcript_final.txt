00:00 Almost every meaningful web application
00:02 has some form of database.
00:05 If you going to log in and have an account
00:07 if you're going to have a listing of items
00:09 even a blog post probably has some form of database.
00:13 Now, simple blogs, they might have just have files on disk
00:17 or maybe somethin' like SQLite
00:19 but real web applications, they have database servers.
00:23 This might be Postgres, it might be MongoDB.
00:25 When you work with those
00:27 there's a lot of things you have to consider.
00:29 How am I going to talk to the database?
00:32 Will I use the SQL query language?
00:34 Will I use an ORM that maps classes into that database?
00:38 How will I make sure that the web server
00:41 is properly connected and securely connected
00:44 to the database server machine and the database itself?
00:47 All these things can be challenging.
00:50 Luckily, Anvil's packaged the web app
00:52 and the database together and they're already wired up
00:56 and ready to talk to each other.
00:58 So this is really great.
00:59 You'll see that workin' with databases in Anvil
01:01 is, well, it's almost transparent.
01:03 In this case that's a good thing.
