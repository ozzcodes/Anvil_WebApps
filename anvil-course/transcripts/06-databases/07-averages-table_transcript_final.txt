00:00 We're going to need one more table for our web app to work.
00:03 When we get to the compare yourself
00:05 against the average person of your age
00:08 and height and things like that
00:10 we need to have that data
00:11 so that we can then compare you to it.
00:13 So, let's add one more table.
00:16 Now, create a new table, averages
00:19 and in here we're going to have just a couple of things.
00:21 We're going to have a text column.
00:23 This will be gender and it'll be like male or female.
00:27 We're going to have a number
00:29 and this is going to be your height, the average height.
00:34 And have a weight.
00:36 And we're going to have a rate as in heart rate.
00:40 And that's it.
00:41 We're going to write a little app to populate this later
00:44 but for now, we're going to have this table just around
00:47 'cause that's going to round out all the tables
00:49 we got to create, might as well do it here.
