00:00 Let's review really quick.
00:01 So, we saw that we have a database system
00:05 already built into Anvil.
00:06 All we have to do is go and enable the data table's service.
00:10 We saw, in our case, that actually was already done
00:13 or as someone created the user management stuff
00:15 but it could be that you create the tables first
00:18 before you do that, and you have to add it explicitly.
00:21 So here we have a couple of tables that we've created
00:24 averages and measurements, and one called users
00:28 that was the one created by the user service.
00:30 And you can see that we've added a record date
00:32 created date, weight in pounds, resting heart rate.
00:35 Those are standard columns, just direct data
00:38 dates, date times, numbers, and so on.
00:41 But we also had a foreign key relationship over to the user.
00:45 This is the user to whom those measurements belong
00:48 and those have a little bit different
00:49 hyperlink-y looking thing here.
00:51 You saw you can even click it
00:52 and pull up details from the user table.
00:54 That's pretty awesome.
00:55 The other thing we have to look at is the security.
00:58 By default, these are not accessible
01:00 and probably should never be writable from Javascript.
01:04 I don't know, that seems like a reasonable statement.
01:07 We have the forms, that is, the client side Javascript
01:10 cannot directly access this table at all.
01:14 However, the server-side modules
01:16 which are run on the server and are protected
01:18 they can do the validation they need
01:19 and then do whatever they want to talk to the database.
01:21 So we had a server-side module that did two things.
01:25 Added these records here and then we query 'em
01:27 for the given logged in user.
01:30 That's data tables.
