00:00 Well, we created our ACPM point
00:02 but let's explore just a little bit
00:03 about how we might pass data.
00:06 There's a number of ways in which you could
00:08 pass data to the API.
00:11 Over here we're just calling /hello
00:14 and we just get a basic response back.
00:17 We could pass something like hello your name
00:20 something like this.
00:21 We could have query parameters x equals seven
00:26 and maybe less obviously
00:28 'cause it's hard to do here
00:29 but we could have a body element
00:31 which is like a JSON document itself
00:34 that we're submitting back.
00:36 So, all three of those are ways
00:37 that we could pass data over.
00:39 And let's just play with those real quick.
00:40 So, if we want to have like /name
00:43 like slash Sarah or whatever
00:45 we can say :name here
00:47 and we can put back the name element there.
00:50 And, if we want to capture the query parameters
00:55 call this query params
00:58 like that, and we get this.
01:00 And if we want to get the JSON body
01:01 I'll just put this here.
01:03 This will be anvil.server.request.
01:04 It's how we get a bunch of stuff about the inbound request.
01:09 And we can say body_json.
01:11 So let's echo the other ones back.
01:14 Okay, so let's just save that.
01:15 That'll refresh this.
01:17 And we come over here
01:18 we can say hello Sarah.
01:22 Like that.
01:23 And we see it says, "Hello Sarah,"
01:25 so it's passed over.
01:27 There's no body passed over
01:28 but we do have the query as x equals seven
01:31 and we could also have y equals 10.
01:34 So we, this actually, if you look at the raw
01:36 this comes in as basically a little sub-dictionary
01:39 with keys and values
01:41 So that's how we pass data over.
01:42 I said we can't really easily pass data in
01:45 using the browser, just like this, for the body.
01:48 We'll see how to do that when we build
01:49 the real meaningful API for our app.
