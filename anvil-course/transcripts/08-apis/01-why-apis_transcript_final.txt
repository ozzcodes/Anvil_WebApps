00:00 In this chapter
00:01 we're going to see how to build HTTP end points
00:03 and JSON based API's with our info application.
00:07 A good question that you might have
00:09 is why would I build an API?
00:11 So let's talk about the power of API's really quick.
00:14 Well, imagine we've got our web app running
00:17 in Anvil up in well, their servers.
00:19 But you know, maybe we consider our server
00:21 It's got a web app
00:22 It's got a database service, the data tables
00:24 all that stuff is over there.
00:26 And how do people work with it?
00:27 Well, they open up their web browser
00:30 either on a PC or on a mobile device
00:33 some kind of phone, and they request the page
00:36 and that's what we built so far.
00:38 They can interact with it, it has the graphs, it has the ad measurement
00:41 the login, all that stuff.
00:42 It's super, but this is only one part of the world.
00:46 It's the most invisible part to be sure
00:48 but it's not the only one
00:49 and not necessarily the most important.
00:52 We might also want to build a really sweet native app
00:56 that we sell through the App Store for iOS or Android.
00:59 And we We'd like to talk to the same data
01:01 basically have a native app version of the website
01:05 that people are going to use.
01:06 How does that talk to our server?
01:08 Well, it's definitely
01:09 not going to just request the same pages.
01:11 I need data in a computer readable format
01:13 like JSON or XML or something else, but not HTML.
01:17 Also, maybe some other websites or services
01:21 want to integrate with ours
01:22 maybe there's some healthcare company
01:24 and they have like a wellness program for their people.
01:27 And they would like to have all the customers of fitness
01:30 have their data integrated in
01:33 so to it automatically records this stuff
01:35 into their system as well.
01:37 If we want to make this happen
01:38 well, of course, we've got to build some API's
01:40 to allow that to happen.
01:42 Now another really powerful reason for API's
01:44 is to break up our app into smaller pieces.
01:47 This doesn't really make a lot of sense for envelopes.
01:50 But when you hear people talk about micro services
01:52 these are maybe a little web app that does authentication
01:55 one that compares measurements
01:56 one that's graph-some, things like that.
01:58 These are obviously connected with API's as well.
02:02 like I said, probably not a use case for anvil
02:04 But certainly a use case for API's.
02:06 So API's are super important
02:08 they connect all these things that make our apps
02:11 more amazing, make the integrations work
02:12 make architectural decisions more flexible.
02:17 But we're going to see how to build API's that are HTTP based
02:20 and sort of JSON in anvil.
02:23 It's easy as you can expect.
