00:00 It's time to expand our application.
00:02 So far, we've only had the Add Measurement control.
00:05 And yeah, it's doing some cool stuff.
00:07 It does validation and it processes the request
00:08 and things like that.
00:10 But, there are many aspects for application
00:12 and so we've already created these different components.
00:15 The CompareComponent and the home details
00:18 the AddMeasurementComponent, and all those things.
00:21 But we need to talk about navigating between them.
00:24 With normal web applications
00:26 standard server side driven web applications
00:28 or even static ones the way navigation happens
00:31 is we navigate by going to different URLs
00:34 and completely reloading the web page.
00:37 Anvil, on the other hand, is different.
00:39 The way Anvil works is it is what's called
00:41 a Single Page Application, often shortened to SPA.
00:45 In a Single Page App, the app does not actually reload.
00:49 As you interact with it, just certain parts are changed.
00:52 The DOM, the Document Object Model and HTML
00:55 is just replaced.
00:56 So here we can see the shell
00:58 the home form that we've already created.
01:00 And there's this section right here.
01:02 Into this little panel, what we're going to do
01:04 is we're going to start dropping different components.
01:08 Let's imagine they've clicked add
01:10 here in the left navigation, and we need to load
01:12 the AddMeasurementComponent into this area.
01:14 So what happens? We sort of did this early on
01:17 just to get things up and running.
01:18 What happens is, we're first going to create
01:21 one of these add measurement components.
01:23 We're just going to call it's initializer in Python.
01:26 Then, potentially, we're going to set some data.
01:28 I don't believe we actually do that
01:30 on the AddMeasurementComponent but if we needed to
01:33 we could go ahead and set some properties
01:35 because maybe the state of one of the components
01:37 needs to be passed over to the other.
01:39 Then, we're going to tell Anvil to update this panel
01:44 which will effectively change the DOM and insert this
01:47 into this little shell thing that we've created.
01:49 So this is how navigation works.
01:52 We're going to load the overall HomeForm
01:53 and it's little component there, that content_panel.
01:57 And then as we interact with the navigation
01:59 and the buttons and the app and so on
02:01 we're just going to create copies, or instances
02:04 of these components and load them up with data
02:06 and set them here.
02:07 As far as the user's concerned
02:09 it's going to be super snappy.
02:10 We're not actually refreshing the page.
02:12 We're not going back to the server.
02:13 We're not navigating the internet.
02:15 This is all client side goodness.
02:17 Of course, we may end up talking to the back end
02:20 to get data, but there's nothing implicit
02:22 about this navigation that does that.
