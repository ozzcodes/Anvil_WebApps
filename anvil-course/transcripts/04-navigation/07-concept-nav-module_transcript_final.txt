00:00 Let's round out this chapter on navigation
00:02 by reviewing where we started
00:04 and where we ended up.
00:06 So we saw that Anvil applications are single-page apps
00:10 that means they all load up at the beginning
00:12 and they never go back to the server
00:14 they don't refresh the page
00:15 as far as the browser's concerned
00:17 we're just on this one page for a super long time.
00:20 But, in fact, we do navigate around
00:21 and the way we do that is by using JavaScript to get data
00:24 which we haven't done a ton of yet but we're going to
00:26 and then manipulating the DOM.
00:29 And the easiest way to do that is
00:31 to just take these components that we built
00:33 like a HomeDetailsComponent
00:34 or an AddMeasurementComponent
00:36 and having Anvil have an area in our page
00:39 which is most of our app
00:41 where we just pop those controls in and out of.
00:44 So, here if we want to load up the home view
00:46 and we've got that HomeForm
00:48 which is a shell in the HomeDetailsComponent
00:50 which is like the here's your recent measurements
00:52 and whatnot
00:53 we're going to go and go to this content panel
00:55 figure whatever happens to be there
00:56 if something is there and then just add the one
00:59 and only home details component like this.
01:01 We potentially could pass additional data to the thing
01:04 but we're not actually doing that
01:05 so that's all well and good.
01:07 We also saw that we can set the title
01:09 we can set the active navigation
01:10 maybe we check for users
01:12 all that would have to be stuck in here
01:13 and it's hard to replicate that in other places, right?
01:16 This is inside the HomeForm.
01:17 We also saw, like, other components might need
01:20 to do stuff like this.
01:21 For example, the AddMeasurementComponent.
01:24 So what's better?
01:25 Well, we're going to move all of this navigation concept
01:28 to a navigation client side module.
01:31 We just called it navigation
01:32 and it has things like go add measurement.
01:35 And it can do and check, does this page require an account?
01:38 Yes, it does
01:39 so we're going to try to get that account.
01:41 If we don't get one, go home
01:43 otherwise, we're going to set the title
01:45 set the active navigation
01:47 and then load that add measurement component, right?
01:50 And then all we do is basically delegate back
01:52 to the home form to say load control and pass it off.
01:56 Also, set_title, set_active_nav and so on.
01:59 So this is a really nice pattern within Anvil applications
02:02 to factor all that kind of stuff
02:03 about moving from view to view
02:05 validation from view to view
02:07 setting up things like the active navigation and the title
02:09 and whether an account is required, all that stuff.
02:12 Really great and this is how you do it.
