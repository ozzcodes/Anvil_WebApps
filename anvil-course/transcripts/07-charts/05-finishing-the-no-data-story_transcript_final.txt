00:00 All right. Our app is looking really good.
00:01 We saw we can get this chart looking fantastic.
00:05 Another thing going on, though
00:06 down here, that's not great is we can show this.
00:10 Alright. Let's actually go and test that.
00:12 Let's in here and set that to be empty.
00:17 All right. Here's our spot where it says
00:19 Hey, there's no data. Maybe you should go add some.
00:22 Well, this is an encouraging button
00:25 but it's behavior is not so encouraging.
00:28 We just need to take them here
00:29 over to add measurement, right?
00:31 That would be great. How do we do that?
00:33 Well, it turns out to be super easy.
00:35 Do we have navigation imported? Not yet.
00:39 Remember we wrote this navigation thing
00:41 specifically so all these components' controls
00:44 can use the navigation stuff
00:45 without knowing or caring about it.
00:48 So let's go to our design
00:50 do the double-click on that thing.
00:52 And then, all we've got to do down here
00:54 we want to go home, is we say, navigation.go_add
00:57 Or go to add an element, we say, go_add like this.
01:02 Let's get rid of this space. There.
01:05 Like so. What do you think? Is it going to work?
01:07 Of course it's going to work because
01:08 our navigation is awesome. Alright.
01:12 Here it is.
01:13 Let's give it a click and see what happens.
01:14 Ready?  Boom.
01:16 Just like that. We can add another measurement.
01:18 If we had deleted our elements out
01:20 maybe that's, maybe that's worth a little try here.
01:22 Let's go and do one more thing.
01:24 Let's go over to our data table.
01:25 Delete out the elements.
01:27 So I can go up here.
01:28 Right now, remember, I'm faking this out
01:30 to only...just only show no data.
01:33 So what I want to do is go through the experience
01:35 of there is no data, I click the button
01:38 I enter an element, then I have data.
01:41 So instead of deleting them
01:42 just so we still have them, I'm going to try
01:44 to simulate that by seeing...
01:46 Let's go for the 6th onward one.
01:49 Alright. Because there's five, and I said
01:51 Give me only the 6th and onward measurements
01:54 this thing thinks there's none.
01:56 So let's go and add one.
01:57 There should be at least one
01:58 and we'll get started from there.
01:59 So we'll say, add measurement
02:01 and I'll pick yesterday.
02:03 Let's say, The weight's 180, heart rate is 69.
02:08 I hit this. It'll take me back home.
02:10 Going back home should realize that
02:12 there's now at least one element
02:14 shows something different. Boom.
02:17 There it goes. Now, why do we see all of these here?
02:18 We see two, four, six because
02:21 remember, I was doing the slice up here; but
02:25 down the bottom we're getting all of them again.
02:27 That works. That's the flow that we're looking for.
02:30 You go there, you land on the page
02:31 you've signed up for an account
02:33 you don't have any measurements.
02:34 Put one in. Boom.
02:36 You're taken back. Now, that graph is shown.
02:38 I think this whole graph and home page thing is
02:41 well, it's pretty good.
02:42 I'm going to call it done.
