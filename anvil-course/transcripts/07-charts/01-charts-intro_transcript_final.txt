00:00 Because our application gathers a bunch
00:02 of measurements, a really nice way
00:03 to display these back to the user
00:06 would be a chart.
00:07 That way they could quickly see what their weight
00:11 or their health is over time.
00:13 So that's what we're going to do in this chapter.
00:14 We're going to create some graphs, some charts
00:16 right on the homepage.
00:17 When people log in, just going to land there and see them.
00:21 But what are we going to use?
00:22 Well, there's a lot of options in Python
00:24 for building really rich, interactive plots in the web.
00:28 One of those is Plotly.
00:30 So here's a really cool graph.
00:31 You can see the life expectancy versus
00:34 per capita GDP from 2007, and what's really nice
00:38 is it's not just a picture.
00:40 You can move around this little red boxes
00:42 when you hold the mouse over, I guess the part
00:45 that's United States, and you can see the different colors
00:48 in areas and so on.
00:49 And also, see that toolbar up at the top?
00:51 You can zoom in, you can pan, you can do all kinds
00:54 of stuff on these graphs
00:56 so they're very, very interactive.
00:57 And in Anvil, it's super easy.
00:59 All you have to do is go over to your toolbox
01:01 grab this little bar chart-looking thing
01:04 bar graph-looking thing, and drag it over
01:06 and then configure it, and it automatically
01:08 brings Plotly into your web app.
01:11 So that's what we're going to do in this chapter
01:12 for our weight and our resting heart rate.
