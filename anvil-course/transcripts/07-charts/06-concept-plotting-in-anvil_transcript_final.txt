00:00 Let's just quickly review the two main steps
00:02 of what we did to set up our chart
00:04 and then put data into it.
00:05 Well, first we set it up
00:07 and we did that by just setting a ton of properties.
00:09 We went to the layout, and we did a bunch
00:11 of stuff with layouts at the title, and the X-axis
00:14 and the Y-axis and so on.
00:16 And on the X-axis, we have a bunch of properties
00:18 like the zero line or show the grid
00:20 or mirror should be ticks and things like that.
00:23 You can just go look at different examples
00:26 in the Plotly galleries and find one you like.
00:28 You're like all right, what are the settings on that thing?
00:30 Let me try that.
00:32 And then you want to put your data into the system.
00:34 So we used our data access to go potentially
00:37 to the web service or to cache, local cache
00:39 and get our measurements.
00:41 And if there's none, well, we don't want to try
00:44 to load this up with nothing.
00:46 That might not work so well.
00:47 But we just bail out
00:48 and then we're going to create three variables
00:50 x for the X-axis, h for heart rate
00:54 and w for weight, and then we go through
00:56 and we just build up the X-axis
00:57 the H-axis, and the W-axis from the different parts
01:00 of our data records.
01:02 Then, super simple, we say go to put plot.
01:04 We set the data to be two graph objects
01:07 a scatterplot, and a bar chart
01:09 where we set the X, the Y, and the name.
01:12 That's it. Now we have a beautiful graph that's highly interactive.
01:15 People are going to love it.
