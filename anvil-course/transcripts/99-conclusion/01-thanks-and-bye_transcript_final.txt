00:00 Look at that, you've made it to the end.
00:02 And there it is, you see it? The finish line
00:05 and you've made it across. Awesome!
00:07 You now possess many of Anvil's super powers.
00:11 And there's actually a bunch of things
00:13 we haven't even spoke about.
00:15 Background processes and other cool stuff like that.
00:18 Go, take your idea, build it on Anvil
00:21 and share it with us when you're done.
00:24 You can put it together without knowing all
00:25 the ins and out of the details of the web.
00:28 You can even try prototyping something there
00:30 and move it into Flask if that's really your end goal.
00:33 So fun little platform, you can build some
00:35 really cool apps as you've seen throughout
00:37 this entire course.
00:38 You can take the code with you.
00:40 Now, sharing the source code with you here
00:44 is different than maybe sharing it with like
00:46 a standard Python course.
00:48 Normally what I would do is just put the Python
00:50 files that you need there, and other resources
00:52 and you would go and use that.
00:53 But Anvil is a little bit different
00:54 so let's break out of this view.
00:56 And actually let me walk you through GitHub
00:58 real quick.
00:59 So here we are at the Anvil Course Repo
01:02 yeah, right now it says private, cause I haven't
01:03 published this course yet, but soon as I do
01:05 that'll be public and you can just get to it.
01:08 So, we've got our source code down here
01:10 and you've already seen two of the things.
01:12 We've added the fitnessd_client
01:14 and the fitnessd_loader.
01:16 Right here is the GUI App that we've built
01:17 for example. Right, you can see it's code here.
01:21 So, this is regular Python code
01:23 you just download this, create a virtual environment
01:25 run the requirements, install the requirements with pip.
01:28 And you can run the app.
01:29 Nothing unusual about that.
01:31 But, for Anvil itself, the thing that we actually get
01:35 when we go over to this thing.
01:38 You can't run this locally, that's not how Anvil works.
01:41 It has to run within Anvil
01:43 cause it's got to tie the client, and the server
01:45 and the database, all that stuff together.
01:47 So I gave you that code, we go back here
01:50 under Anvil App.
01:52 I gave it to you in two forms.
01:54 You can export from Git, the actual raw code
01:57 you can clone it, and if you go down here
02:00 you can see the forms.
02:01 For example, here's the UI definition of our Account page.
02:06 It looks like this YAML stuff.
02:09 And here's our card, and let's see
02:11 stuff that we'll recognize here.
02:14 Label gender, for example, right?
02:17 And then here's the Python code, it is the code
02:19 behind for it, right?
02:20 Here's our Go Pro that we just did
02:22 and there's the code.
02:23 So this is really nice, you actually have the code locally.
02:27 You can work with it, you can do whatever you want.
02:29 With like a local editor and copy code around
02:33 from maybe here, into your real app.
02:35 That's a really nice thing, if I want to just copy
02:38 this whole method into my app
02:40 just go here and just copy into your app.
02:42 However, this can't be run, right?
02:45 So I just gave you this, you can download it
02:46 and have the code locally as text files.
02:49 If you want to run and edit the code
02:51 you have to clone it into your account.
02:54 So over here there's runable, and to do that
02:57 you just click on this thing here.
02:58 It says, "okay, you can start it by clicking this."
03:00 and it says Michael has invited you to work
03:06 on a copy of their app.
03:07 Okay, so that's what you would get.
03:09 That's how you would actually get a runable version.
03:11 That you can tweak and play with, and so on.
03:13 It's a lot of fun, you have all the code
03:15 I think everything you need to take exactly what
03:18 we built right during this course
03:19 and run with it.
03:21 So finally, thank you for taking my course.
03:23 I'm Michael Kennedy, follow me on twitter
03:25 where I'm @mkennedy.
03:27 Check out our other courses over at training.talkpython.fm
03:30 and go build something awesome with Anvil.
