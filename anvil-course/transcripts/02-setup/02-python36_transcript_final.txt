00:00 The next thing you're going to need to install is Python
00:02 and it's important that you have Python 3.6 or higher.
00:06 The primary feature we may end up using from 3.6
00:09 or higher is f-strings
00:10 but there are other ones that we could
00:12 accidentally use as well.
00:14 Current version is 3.7, at the time of the recording
00:17 but 3.6 or above should be totally fine.
00:19 Now you may be thinking
00:20 "Michael, one of the big benefits of Anvil
00:23 is I can create these webapps in my browser.
00:26 I don't have to have an editor
00:28 or Python locally, or anything like that
00:30 so why do I need to install Python?"
00:33 Well, here's the thing, for Anvil, absolutely.
00:36 It runs up there in the Anvil cloud
00:39 you don't have to do anything
00:41 you just work with your editor
00:42 in your browser and you're golden.
00:44 However, during this course
00:46 we're going to look at some
00:47 of the more advanced features of Anvil
00:49 one of them being working with the http endpoints
00:53 that we can create in Anvil.
00:54 So we're going to write some client-side applications
00:57 that talk to our server-side Anvil code.
00:59 For that, you need Python 3.6.
01:02 If you don't want to do that particular part
01:03 you can actually skip installing Python
01:06 but I think Python's good, right?
01:08 So, you probably do want to follow along
01:10 but if you absolutely don't
01:11 and you don't mind skipping that section
01:13 then you can just stick with your web browser
01:14 and you'll be golden.
01:17 Let's assume you do want to have Python 3.6 or above
01:20 you might ask the question, "Do I have Python?"
01:22 If you're on MacOS or Linux
01:24 you can just type python3 -V and it'll tell you the version
01:28 or it'll tell you there's an error
01:29 and there's no Python 3.
01:31 So, assuming you don't get an error
01:33 you see the version, hopefully you've got the right one
01:35 if it's out of date, upgrade it.
01:37 If you don't have it at all, then you need to go install it.
01:41 If you're on Windows, you type either python -V
01:46 sometimes you can type python3 -V
01:49 depending on how you've installed it.
01:51 Most of the time the three doesn't work
01:53 but in the newer versions it does.
01:56 We'll talk about that more in just a second.
01:58 So, go to your terminal or your command prompt
01:59 see if you've got Python
02:01 if you've got 3.6 or above you're good.
02:04 If you happen to need to install it
02:05 I recommend you check out the guide
02:06 from my friends over at Real Python.
02:08 That's realpython.com/installing-python
02:11 they talk about how to set it up on Mac
02:14 on Windows, on Linux, and all those things
02:16 and one really new thing, if you're on Windows
02:21 and that Windows is the latest version of Windows 10
02:24 mid to late 2019, then you can actually
02:29 go to the Windows Store.
02:31 Go to the store app, store in your Windows, Windows Store
02:34 search for Python, you'll find Python 3.7 or 3.8
02:37 and you can install that.
02:38 That will give you probably the best
02:41 Python experience on Windows.
02:43 That little example of typing python3
02:45 that will work if you install it this way
02:47 but not if you install it from python.org for example.
02:50 So if you're on Windows, this is a really great way.
02:52 It auto-updates within minor versions
02:55 and all those kinds of things.
02:56 Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher
02:58 if you want to follow along on the client-side bit
03:01 of work that we're going to do.
