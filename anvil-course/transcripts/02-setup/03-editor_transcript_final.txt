00:00 We're going to need a proper editor
00:01 to write Python code when we're working locally.
00:04 Again, it doesn't make any sense
00:06 or it's not really a feature of Anvil to use a local
00:09 editor against our remote Anvil code.
00:12 That's what anvil.works and the whole Editor Online is there
00:16 and what that's all about, but again
00:18 we're going to work on some local client-side applications
00:21 that talk to our server code through APIs that we're
00:23 going to create during this course.
00:25 For that, we're going to need an editor
00:27 so I recommend that you check out PyCharm
00:28 that's my favorite, that's what I'm going to be using.
00:31 Close second would be VS Code with the Python plugin.
00:35 Those are both really good options.
00:36 We're going to use PyCharm.
00:37 You should be able to use the Community Edition
00:39 the free edition of PyCharm for this course.
