00:00 Allow me just a tiny, little diversion here.
00:02 We're talking about how we came up
00:04 with the name "Fitnessd", without the "E".
00:06 I find naming products and naming companies super hard.
00:11 For this one I thought,
00:13 Okay I want to have something that sounds cool
00:14 but I'm not going to infringe on anyone's copyright
00:17 or use a name that's already used somewhere else
00:19 or something like that.
00:21 So I ran across this place called Namelix,
00:23 and if you're working on a product
00:24 you might find it interesting as well.
00:26 So I'm just interested in fitness.
00:28 Let's even say health, something like that.
00:30 I'm trying to maybe get a little off to the side.
00:32 And you say, "I want a medium length names, short names."
00:34 And then I can have brandable names
00:37 like Google or Turo so that they're easily
00:40 to create brands and copyrights and so on.
00:43 So if we go and say that, we can ask this AI
00:46 to generate not just names but logos and colors
00:50 and all sorts of stuff around here.
00:52 It can have, um, in health,
00:54 let's see.. Nutrick, Lenity, Bealth.
00:59 I don't know about that, it's a little bit funky, right?
01:02 This is basically how I came up with Fitnessd, right.
01:05 I can come over here and there's Nurturing, Uh, let's see,
01:08 Ensurity. If you open these up it'll actually let you pick
01:12 different designs and it will create little logos for you.
01:16 So, like this one you could even purchase graphics around.
01:19 It's kind of ridiculous, I have no affiliation with this.
01:22 Open it up, it'll even do things like show you T-shirts
01:26 or business cards, how it would look.
01:28 So, this is how we came up with Fitnessd
01:30 I just put "fitness" in here and went through a bunch
01:32 of options and thought "Fitnessd without the 'E'
01:34 would be kind of cool."
01:36 If you're trying to name a product,
01:37 I have no affiliation with these guys,
01:38 I just thought this was cool
01:40 and it kind of gives you some perspective.
01:42 Here's how we came up with the name.
