00:00 Finally, before we kick off this course
00:02 I just want to tell you that if you want to dive deeper
00:05 into Anvil and you want to hear the story
00:07 of why it was created
00:08 how some of the internals work and so on
00:10 I interviewed over on the Talk Python To Me Podcast
00:13 on Episode 138 Meredydd Luff.
00:16 He's one of the co-creators, co-founders of Anvil.
00:20 We talk all about why did he built it, why does it exist
00:23 why does it work this way, a lot of the internals
00:25 and things like that, so you might enjoy listening to this.
00:28 It's about an hour, you know, take it with you on a drive
00:30 or while you're doing some errands.
00:33 It'll give you a personal perspective
00:35 of what we're about to learn.
